to change text to actual function:
        p <- function(x) {
        eval(parse(text = formula))
         }

what will be the sainty check for concavity of loglikelihood function?
          first derviate test : derivative of loglikehood function should be monotonically decreasing 
          econd derivative test? : second deritvate is non - positive. (to make it more robust).
          package needed : PRACMA
